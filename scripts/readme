python scripts for feature extraction, and image visualization

BSpline_heart_1.py: Manual image segmentation using B-Splines. The following keys (keyboard) are required:
n: next image
x: save segmentations
Esc: close video. In this point, the program will ask to continue or not (y/n).

Initially, the program displays the first image (ED) with the B-Spline. The user can move the control points using the mouse (holding the left bottom).
Once the control points were placed according with the reference segmentation, the user can press 'n' to open the next image (ES).
Similarly, the user can adjust the control points to fit the B-spline to the reference image segmentation.
Afterwards, the user can press 'n' to finish the segmentation of that video. 
If the results are good, the user can save the segmentations pressing 'x'.
Finally, pressing 'Esc' the user has two options: close the program or open the next video.
